# Implementing Classes

OOP is still a very relevant paradigm in business (or real-world) applications. We tend to analyse real-world scenarios or objects with varying complexity e.g., a calculator, a school, a shop, a board game etc... The objects we create are a mere abstraction of what exists in the real world but the ability to remove the noise and model a complex entity into its most bare form is what makes the OOP paradigm so powerful. 

The moment OOP becomes complex... it sucks!

- D.1.10 Describe how data items can be passed to and from actions as parameters.
- D.3.3 Define the terms: private, protected, public, static.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of OOP

Many text books and educational organizations think of this way, deconstructing something in terms of pros and cons, and naturally try to apply it to OOP. In all honesty, from a developer's point of view it really does not work that way. When you look at pros and cons and try to weigh them it normally means you have a choice. 

OOP is not a clear choice that you can easily back away from. It is almost like saying "the advantages and disadvantages of eating a potatoe". If you want to build generic solutions quickly for real-world business scenarios using the best programming frameworks out there - then you are going to exercise some flavour of the OOP paradigm. Here are some examples:

- Python's Django was not intended to be OOP and does not implement it in its purest form, but once you learn the discipline of OOP, the framework is so much easier to learn. 
- Pytorch by Facebook is a framework that allows developers to leverage high performance hardware for the purpose of deep learning and it is designed around OOP principles.
- Ruby on Rails used by Twitter is OOP in its purest form to build high performance web applications.
- Java Spring. OOP is synonymous with Java being the founder programming language of the paradigm.
- PHP Laravel is a very neat framework to build APIs using the OOP paradigm. 

So what?

I will put it this way:

There is a good way to use OOP i.e., using SOLID principles gives you a lot of advantages, and a bad way of using OOP i.e., becomes too complex too quickly and hence a headache to maintain or work within a development team.

Same like eating a potatoe, bake it with the skin on and get all the nutritional value, yes it takes longer than deep frying it and perhaps less fun and funky, but deep frying it is simply not the best way to consume all the goodness the humble potatoe has to offer.

> When using OOP apply SOLID principles to gain all of the advantages. If you choose to use OOP and ignore the principles then prepare yourself for a lot of headaches.

# UML to design SOLID OOP

## What is UML?

A standard visual way of representing the architecture of a software system that makes use of the OOP paradigm. It is not dependant on knowing a single programming language. It concisely and accurately illustrates the relationships and dependencies between modules of a system. The best way of learning SOLID OOP is by interpreting *well* designed UML diagrams. From a UML, it is then very easy to translate it to object-oriented code. Writing SOLID code cold turkey is very difficult to do and it is not recommended.
