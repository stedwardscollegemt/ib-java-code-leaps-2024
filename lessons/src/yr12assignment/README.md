# Year 12 Java Assignment (2022 - 2023)

This piece of individual work will contribute towards your Continuous Assessment (10 Marks) which is part of your Mid-Year report.

## My Simple Banking Application

### Assignment Scope

For this assignment you will build a rudimentary personal banking application in Java using techniques you learned. The program will only have the most basic functions of a bank account:
- <b>Display Account Information</b><br/>
  *This will display the balance and a list of transactions.*
- <b>Add Money</b><br/>
  *This will ask the user to enter card details, and an amount, which will be added to the balance.*
- <b>Send Money</b><br/>
  *This will ask the user to enter an amount, and a contact, and the amount will be deducted from the balance.*
- <b>Quit</b><br/>
  *This will exit the application.*

Initially, the program loads transactions from a text file and displays a menu to help the user operate the application. The program will prompt the user to make a choice, and depending on the choice, the appropriate function will be invoked. Depending on the function, the overall balance or transaction data may be altered.

### Why do you need this assignment?

Many popular applications tend to feature in our discussion during lessons and most of you are keen on becoming proficient with Java. Having a menu-based program like this one is the best way to get your portfolio started. Revolut happens to be a very popular application, and is the inspiration behind this simple assignment. You already proved some ability with the `MathPalChallenge.java` and this is only a few steps above. 

### Exit Skills

- Able to build on someone else's work.
- Design and build a program based on a specification.
- Fill in gaps independently and be comfortable learning new skills on your own.

### ArrayHelper.java

Try to take advantage of work previous students did when doing this assignmment of the same difficulty. You can use or add to the utility class depending on your needs. Unique contributions that are of a high quality will be kept for future students.

## What to deliver

A zipped folder that contains a Visual Studio Code Java Project which obeys the following structure:

- `MySimpleBankingApp.java` which contains the `main()`
- `MySimpleTransactions.txt`
- `ArrayHelper.java` in a `helpers` folder

## Have the right attitude

Assignments tend to have a bad rep because of the pressure that comes with them. If you make it all about the pressure then you will not get the learning outcomes you need. Assignments like this should be *fun* to do. There is no need to get overwhelmed and I promise you that this assignment is doable. In fact, a five minute Google search will give you a good template to start from: (https://www.javaforstudents.co.uk/Practice/Bank_account/). You have more than enough resources to complete the assignment. The whole point of this assignment is to completely immerse yourself for a resonable amount of time and get comfortable with programming.
