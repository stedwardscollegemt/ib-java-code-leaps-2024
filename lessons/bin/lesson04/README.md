# Iteration

## 4.1 Introduction

Allows us to instruct the computer to carry out a task over, and over again by repeating a small body (encapsulated in {}) of code. The programming structure that is used to control this repetition is often called a loop.

- Define the operators =, â‰ , <, <=, >, >=, mod, div
- Construct algorithms using looops and branching.

## 4.3 While Loop

Sometimes, repetition which is not fixed is required. In such cases a for loop is not very useful. However, the `while` loop offers non-fixed iteration.

```
while(/* test goes here */) {
    // instruction (s) to be repeated go here
}
```
