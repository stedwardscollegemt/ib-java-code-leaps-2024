## Simple Data Types in Java

We need our programs to store and manipulate data so it becomes valuable information. We are surrounded by different kinds of data, therefore Javat allows
us to easily classify various data into different types:

- `int` is short for `Integer` and can store whole numbers e.g. 1, 2, -4
- `float` is short for floating-point and can store real numbers within a specific range e.g 0.1, 0.005, 6.7
- `double` is a real number but we use the type to store numbers of a wider range than `float` e.g. 56789321.1, 3.4, 898989898989.2221 
- `char` is short for character so it stores alphanumeric symbols e.g. 'a', '&', '*'
- `boolean` stores `true` or `false` this is the smallest unit of data that can be processed by any computer because it is binary
